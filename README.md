# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

 -Analyzed a Kaggle dataset with 284,807 rows and 31 columns to classify fraudulent transactions using machine learning
algorithms, used Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
– Applied SMOTE for over-sampling and under-sampling to address dataset imbalance; implemented and evaluated Logistic
Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
– Logistic Regression achieved the highest performance across key classification metrics, demonstrating effective fraud detection
